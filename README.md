# MVP

This app is running on iOS built using XCode. It is a recipe search app that uses the Edemam API to query the data. The app has a xib place inside a table view to render both the title of the recipe and the image. Tapping on the cell will bring you to the actual recipe using the WKWebView that allows you to read and follow along with while cooking.
