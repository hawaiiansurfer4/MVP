This is a recipe search app that uses the Edemam API to query the data. The app has a xib place inside a table view to render both the title of the recipe and the image. Tapping on the cell will bring you to the actual recipe that you can read and follow along with while cooking.![IMG_0137](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62270910/125014286-42410780-e022-11eb-9cae-0a6dbcceadc8.PNG)
